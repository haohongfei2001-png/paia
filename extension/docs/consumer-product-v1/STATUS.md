## Activation evidence

The planning-time blocker is cleared on remote `main`:

- CPR-02 is PASS in `extension/docs/chatgpt-project-recognition-v1/STATUS.md`;
- CPR-02 candidate PR #47 is merged;
- CPR-02 exact-main certification is recorded as run `35792666267`;
- the previous writer is RELEASED;
- Consumer Product v1 planning PR #48 is merged at `c1d448fc51261369398f7e12aaacaafd233e23d2`.

Per the owner-authorized night execution route, do not start CPR-03 or the old PRD-03 queue merely because they remain named in historical packages. Their useful requirements are absorbed into this Consumer Product execution queue unless a later round explicitly cites them as evidence.

## CPV1-01.0 closure

verdict: COMPLETE / PASS

candidate_pr: #49

candidate_head: `e61efc25764e3deb20883af2823c895f5b31f598`

candidate_certification: `PAIA Certification #544 / run 35807440190 / SUCCESS`

merged_main: `f2a8f3e7ba223b23428b6c5d902689158b92d4e1`

exact_main_certification: `PAIA Certification #545 / run 35813114522 / attempt 1 / SUCCESS`

runtime_change: NONE

The baseline/failure map is complete. Closure also corrects execution routing so
legacy CPR/PRD/ANS/UI packages cannot be resumed as parallel queues, and aligns
all VS-01 round references with canonical `MASTER_PLAN.md`.

## CPV1-01.1 closure

verdict: COMPLETE / PASS

candidate_pr: #50

candidate_head: `6c8fd7db3b6fcfcaa65ec7b4362141eb5f600e26`

candidate_certification: `PAIA Certification run 35830763983 / SUCCESS`

merged_runtime_main: `3cf6ed71ff51d13d198fcff519701df350bfb156`

exact_main_certification: `PAIA Certification run 35834999379 / SUCCESS`

receipt: `receipts/CPV1-01.1.md`

The durable save and bounded recovery boundary passed the current full suite and Chrome lifecycle tests on the exact integrated runtime. Recovery drafts remain expiring local protection and are not Source/history truth or Backup content. The next round owns extension/page version handshake and reconnect.

## CPV1-01.2 closure

verdict: COMPLETE / PASS

candidate_pr: #51

candidate_head: `7e48eee12565c115875d4724fcabab098b4b134a`

merged_runtime_main: `2fbcf5356d3b023cc476bd5640b260662de26fcd`

exact_main_certification: `PAIA Certification run 35853925872 / SUCCESS`

receipt: `receipts/CPV1-01.2.md`

The version handshake rejects stale-page capture before writing and gives the user one clear refresh action. Headless lifecycle evidence covers old/new/restored tabs without archive loss or duplicate capture. CURRENT_LIVE provider-site lifecycle remains assigned to CPV1-01.6 and is not claimed here.

## Current owner authorization and execution

The owner explicitly superseded the temporary nine-round limit with continuous whole-package development authorization on 2026-09-23. `WHOLE_PACKAGE_PREAUTHORIZED` covers the canonical Consumer Product v1 slice sequence, subject to each round/slice contract and unchanged owner gates in `EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`. The prior counters above are historical only and do not cap this authorization. Publication, new external accounts/credentials, paid services, permission/privacy expansion, destructive migration and legal commitments remain separate owner decisions.

`CPV1-01.3 — Consumer update flow` is ACTIVE in PR #53 on the sole writer branch `manager/cpv1-01-3-consumer-update-20260923`. The round remains open until its own engineering and exact-main closure. Continue the existing PR; do not start a second overlapping writer.

## Slice queue

| Slice | State | User outcome |
|---|---|---|
| VS-01 Safe open, update and recovery | ACTIVE | Existing archive survives ordinary lifecycle/update and failures without engineering intervention |
| VS-02 Source structure to world-class Reader | PLANNED | Captured conversations appear in the correct Project and open in a coherent fast Reader |
| VS-03 History import, export and recoverable large library | PLANNED | Real official history imports safely and the supported archive can actually be restored |
| VS-04 Natural editing and fast lexical retrieval | PLANNED | Direct editing, undo, search, filtering and reuse feel like one document product |
| VS-05 Living Topics and AI Organize | PLANNED | Cross-conversation Thought becomes a readable long-term topic with faithful AI organization |
| VS-06 Complete AI Context reuse | PLANNED | Inputs/Topics/cross-Topic material become reviewable authorized Context without silent truncation |
| VS-07 Semantic retrieval and longitudinal revisit | PLANNED | Users can find forgotten differently-worded ideas and compare real historical expression |
| VS-08 Real read-only AI connector | PLANNED | A supported AI can actually query authorized PAIA material and revocation works |
| VS-09 Prompt reuse phases 1–2 | PLANNED | Frequent prompts can be reused in PAIA and inserted into supported AI input without auto-send |
| VS-10 Mobile MyWrite and voice | PLANNED | Phone users can quickly write/speak into the same PAIA system and recover interruptions |
| VS-11 Multi-source and device continuity | PLANNED | Multiple sources/devices converge without losing edits or resurrecting deleted material |
| VS-12 Authorized AI write proposals and reply-aware prompting | PLANNED | External AI can propose safe PAIA organization changes and reply-aware prompts under distinct permission |

## Core desktop candidate gate

VS-01 through VS-06 COMPLETE is the first Consumer Product v1 desktop candidate.

It is not the full long-term product. VS-07 through VS-12 remain committed product directions where PRODUCT_INTENT_CONTRACT.md marks them confirmed/future rather than optional ideas to be silently dropped.

## Status mutation rule

STATUS.md is the only Consumer Product v1 execution queue after activation.

A manager may change a round from READY to ACTIVE only after:

1. remote main is re-read;
2. no conflicting writer exists;
3. the round contract is read;
4. owner authorization mode permits execution.

A slice becomes COMPLETE only after every applicable evidence class in VERIFICATION.md is satisfied.
