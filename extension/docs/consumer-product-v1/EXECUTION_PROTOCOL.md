# Execution Protocol — PAIA Consumer Product v1

## 1. Manager model

This package is designed for a high-reasoning ChatGPT manager operating against GitHub remote main.

The manager is responsible for product/technical integration. Codex or another coding agent may implement bounded tasks, but the manager owns:

- current-state reconstruction;
- task decomposition;
- review;
- integration;
- CI interpretation;
- real-browser evidence;
- UX convergence;
- status/receipt closure.

The product owner is not the manual project manager.

## 2. Authorization modes

Default after package activation:

- "继续 PAIA" when no slice is active authorizes the one slice marked READY as WHOLE_SLICE_PREAUTHORIZED.
- The manager may execute all ordinary rounds in that slice without asking the owner after each round.
- "继续" during an active slice resumes that same slice.
- A new slice is not automatically started after the current slice closes unless the owner has explicitly granted whole-package continuous authorization.

The owner can explicitly grant WHOLE_PACKAGE_PREAUTHORIZED later. Even then, owner gates below still stop execution.

## 3. True owner gates

Stop and ask the owner only for:

- a Product Intent conflict listed in AUTHORITY.md;
- a new privacy/data-collection permission;
- a new external account permission with meaningful user-data access;
- a paid plan, billing account, purchase or new recurring cost commitment;
- an irreversible/destructive migration not already covered by an approved migration contract;
- a legal/public-release commitment;
- a genuinely personal semantic judgment that independent evaluation cannot establish.

Do not ask the owner to choose:

- component libraries;
- CSS values;
- ordinary data structures;
- refactor boundaries;
- test repairs;
- accessibility fixes;
- performance tuning;
- ordinary dependencies;
- code organization;
- retry/backoff mechanics within an approved privacy/cost envelope.

## 4. Start-of-round protocol

For every round:

1. Resolve current remote main HEAD.
2. Read STATUS.md, AUTHORITY.md and the current slice/round contract.
3. Read only relevant current PRODUCT/ARCHITECTURE/history needed for compatibility.
4. Inspect current code and recent commits; do not assume the planning baseline is current.
5. Confirm there is no other writer touching the same runtime/data boundary.
6. Reuse correct work already on main or an active PR; do not redo it.
7. Record the exact start SHA in the round receipt/status.

## 5. Implementation rules

- Product behavior is fixed by higher intent; implementation may change.
- Prefer deleting obsolete UI coordination after the replacement path is certified; do not leave permanent dual behavior.
- Never weaken an old safety test merely to make a new design pass.
- Do not convert a failed normal capability into a PASS by demonstrating a fallback.
- No real private archive text enters Git, CI logs or public screenshots.
- No hidden paid AI retry, remote upload or new provider permission.
- Current Source, human edits, revisions, deletion fences and authorization must survive migrations.

## 6. UI implementation-first convergence

There is no mandatory standalone prototype phase.

For a UI round:

1. implement the real production path behind an isolated route/feature gate where needed;
2. exercise it with realistic synthetic long-form data and all relevant states;
3. capture representative desktop/narrow screenshots or browser recordings;
4. audit against UX_CONTRACT.md for hierarchy, density, actions, focus, errors and long-content behavior;
5. fix deviations in the same round;
6. only then close the round.

"Looks cleaner" is not an acceptance criterion.

## 7. Verification progression

A round normally progresses:

DESIGN/RECONSTRUCT → IMPLEMENT → TARGETED TEST → FULL REQUIRED CI → REAL BROWSER/DEVICE WHEN APPLICABLE → UX/PERFORMANCE REVIEW → MERGE → EXACT-MAIN CHECK → RECEIPT → STATUS UPDATE.

If any required stage fails, fix within the round or close BLOCKED/FAIL with the evidence preserved.

## 8. Branch and merge discipline

- One integration writer per data/schema/runtime boundary.
- Small PRs are encouraged, but product acceptance remains the round/slice contract.
- Candidate CI is not exact-main CI.
- After merge, perform the round's exact-main checks before marking COMPLETE.
- Documentation-only status commits must describe the runtime SHA they certify and must not imply the docs SHA itself is the runtime.

## 9. Slice boundary

When a slice completes:

- update STATUS.md;
- publish a compact receipt containing exact SHAs and evidence;
- state remaining known limitations honestly;
- release writer ownership;
- stop unless authorization covers the next slice.

The owner should see a user-visible capability summary, not raw engineering logs.
